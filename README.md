This was a solution for the "Sleep Shift Scheduling Tool" challenge by Team Circadian Stability.

Our project addresses this challenge through a simple algorithm that presents an optimized schedule based on times the user inputs for sleep, and special circumstances. This is important because it simplifies sleep scheduling for those who have unusual disruptions in their sleep patterns. Essentially, it takes into account typical sleep hours for the user and balances out sleep hours (based on offsets) so that one's circadian rhythm is not ruined. Additionally, our project presents optimal exercise and eating times in order to stay fit. We hope to achieve a useful tool that will help astronauts and flight controllers alike to manage their sleep times.
